## 📊 Statistics Cheat Sheet

### Central Tendency Formulas
```
Mean = Σx / n
Median = Middle value(s)
Mode = Most frequent value
```

### Dispersion Formulas
```
Variance = Σ(x - mean)² / n
Std Deviation = √Variance
Range = Max - Min
```

### Probability
```
P(A) = Favorable Outcomes / Total Outcomes
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
```

### Normal Distribution
```
Z-score = (x - mean) / std_deviation
68% of data within ±1σ
95% of data within ±2σ
99.7% of data within ±3σ
```
